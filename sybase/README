This is a hardcoded internal authentication function for use with
mod_auth_external or mod_authnz_external.  It supports authenticating
from a Sybase database using the DB lib interface.

It assumes the existence of a table named "users" in your database, with
fields named "login" and "passwd" which are both adequately large varchar
types.  Passwords are stored as plain text, which Jan Wolter considers a
grevious mistake.  Better to encrypt them with something like crypt(3).
