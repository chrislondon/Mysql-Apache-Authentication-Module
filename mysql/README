The MySQL auth program is by Anders Nordby <anders@fix.no> who maintains it
at http://anders.fix.no/software/#unix

See the header of the auth-mysql.pl file for the author's notes.

This require the Perl DBI/DBD libraries for mysql:
  http://cpan.valueclick.com/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces/DBI/
  http://cpan.valueclick.com/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces/DBD/

Configuration is mostly by editing the definitions at the front of the
mysql-auth.pl.

In the likely event that your SQL tables have different field names, you'll
also have to edit the SQL query in the call to $dbh->prepare().

If you want to use a database server other than MySQL, you'll need the DBD
library for that database and you'll need to change the DBI->connect() call.
