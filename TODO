 - Look into developing a "socket" method, in which we first try open a
   socket connecting to the external authenticator, and only launch a new one
   if the initial connection attempt fails.  This would avoid launching a
   new authenticator for each hit.  Instead the authenticator would be a
   persistant process that can hold open a connection to the database and
   even do caching of recent authentications.

 - Improve Windows support.  Theoretically version 3.2.0 should work on
   windows, but I don't do windows development and can't test it or
   document installation procedures.

 - I think the apache data structure r->subprocess_env is a table into which
   various modules place environment variable definitions that they want to
   have passed into CGI programs, for example, mod_ssl puts HTTPS and a
   bunch of other variables here.  Should I load all of them into the
   environment for the external authenticator?  Needs study.
