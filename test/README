These are dummy external authenticator programs used for testing
mod_auth_external or mod_authnz_external.

They are all Perl scripts.  Before using them, make sure that the
#!/usr/bin/perl directives in the first lines give the correct pathname
for the Perl interpretor on your system.

The files are:

   test.pipe        Dummy user authentication program using pipe method
   test.env         Dummy user authentication program using environment method
   testgroup.pipe   Dummy group check program using pipe method
   testgroup.env    Dummy group check program using environment method

The user authentication programs will accept a login if the user name
matches the password, and will reject all others.

The group check programs will accept a login if the user name matches the
group name, and will reject all others.

All programs print lots of stuff to stderr.  All this output should get
logged in Apache's "error_log" file, so do a "tail -f" on that file to
see what happens when you try an authentication.

(Obviously you wouldn't want to log plain-text passwords in a real
authentication program).
