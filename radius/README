Older versions of mod_auth_external included an example of a hard
coded internal authentication function which was designed for
authenticating from a Radius server.

It is no longer included in the mod_auth_external distribution because
its license did not appear to be a full open source license.

People interested in a radius authenticator, should probably look into
mod_auth_radius.

For the time being, the old contents of this directory will be available
from http://unixpapa.com/software/mae_radius.tar.gz
